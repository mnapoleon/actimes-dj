# Driver Management Card Separation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the refactoring of the session detail page to separate the driver management functionality from the lap times table into its own dedicated card component. This will improve UI organization, visual hierarchy, and provide better separation of concerns.

## Current State

The driver management section is currently embedded within the "Lap Times" card as a nested light-colored card (`bg-light`) positioned between the table header and the actual lap times table (lines 86-107 in `session_detail.html`).

**Current Structure:**
```
Session Information Card
Lap Times Chart Card  
Lap Times Card
├── Card Header (title + filters)
├── Driver Management Section (nested card)
└── Lap Times Table + Pagination
```

## Proposed Changes

### New Structure
```
Session Information Card
Lap Times Chart Card
Driver Management Card (NEW)
Lap Times Card (MODIFIED)
├── Card Header (title + filters)
└── Lap Times Table + Pagination
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Driver Management Card

#### 1.1 Create New Driver Management Card
- **Location**: Between lap times chart card and lap times table card
- **Position**: Lines 59-60 in `session_detail.html` (after chart card, before lap times card)
- **Design**: Full card with proper header, body, and styling

#### 1.2 Card Structure
```html
<div class="card mb-4">
    <div class="card-body">
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-3">
            <h2 class="card-title mb-0">Driver Management</h2>
            <small class="text-muted">{{ drivers|length }} driver{{ drivers|length|pluralize }}</small>
        </div>
        <p class="text-muted mb-3">Manage drivers in this session. Remove drivers to delete all their lap data.</p>
        <!-- Driver management content -->
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 1.3 Enhanced Driver Management Features
- **Driver Statistics**: Show lap count per driver
- **Visual Improvements**: Better spacing and layout
- **Confirmation Enhancement**: Improved delete confirmation with lap count

### Phase 2: Update Lap Times Card

#### 2.1 Remove Embedded Driver Management
- Remove lines 86-107 from current `session_detail.html`
- Clean up the gap between header and table
- Simplify the lap times card to focus only on table display

#### 2.2 Header Simplification
- Keep filter and sort controls in the header
- Remove driver management clutter
- Maintain responsive design for filter controls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Driver Management Features ✅ COMPLETED

#### 3.1 Driver Statistics Display - IMPLEMENTED
```html
<div class="row g-3">
    {% for driver in drivers %}
    <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4">
        <div class="card border-secondary">
            <div class="card-body py-2">
                <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
                    <div>
                        <h6 class="card-title mb-0">{{ driver }}</h6>
                        <small class="text-white fw-bold">{{ driver_lap_counts|get_item:driver }} lap{{ driver_lap_counts|get_item:driver|pluralize }}</small>
                    </div>
                    <a href="{% url 'driver_delete_confirm' session.pk driver %}" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger" 
                       title="Delete all {{ driver_lap_counts|get_item:driver }} lap{{ driver_lap_counts|get_item:driver|pluralize }} for {{ driver }}">
                        <i class="bi bi-trash"></i>
                    </a>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

**Changes Made:**
- Driver cards implemented with responsive grid layout
- Lap counts displayed with white text for visibility
- Delete buttons converted from form submissions to confirmation page links
- Proper pluralization for lap counts
- Enhanced tooltips with specific lap count information

#### 3.2 Professional Confirmation Page (Replaced JavaScript) - IMPLEMENTED
Instead of JavaScript confirmation, implemented a full confirmation page matching the session delete pattern:

**New URL Pattern:**
```python
path(
    "session/<int:session_pk>/delete-driver/<str:driver_name>/confirm/",
    views.DriverDeleteView.as_view(),
    name="driver_delete_confirm",
),
```

**New View (DriverDeleteView):**
```python
class DriverDeleteView(TemplateView):
    """View for confirming driver deletion"""
    
    template_name = "laptimes/driver_confirm_delete.html"
    
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        session_pk = self.kwargs["session_pk"]
        driver_name = self.kwargs["driver_name"]
        
        context["session"] = get_object_or_404(Session, pk=session_pk)
        context["driver_name"] = driver_name
        
        # Get driver's laps for statistics
        driver_laps = context["session"].laps.filter(driver_name=driver_name)
        context["lap_count"] = driver_laps.count()
        context["driver_laps"] = driver_laps.order_by("lap_number")[:5]  # Show first 5 laps
        
        return context
    
    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        """Handle the actual deletion"""
        session_pk = self.kwargs["session_pk"]  
        driver_name = self.kwargs["driver_name"]
        
        session = get_object_or_404(Session, pk=session_pk)
        laps_to_delete = session.laps.filter(driver_name=driver_name)
        lap_count = laps_to_delete.count()
        
        if lap_count > 0:
            laps_to_delete.delete()
            messages.success(
                request,
                f'Successfully removed driver "{driver_name}" and all {lap_count} lap{"" if lap_count == 1 else "s"} from this session.',
            )
        else:
            messages.warning(
                request, f'No laps found for driver "{driver_name}" in this session.'
            )
        
        return redirect("session_detail", pk=session_pk)
```

**New Template (`driver_confirm_delete.html`):**
- Professional Bootstrap styling with danger theme
- Driver details with lap count and session information
- Sample laps table showing first 5 laps to be deleted
- Warning alerts about permanent data loss
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Cancel and confirm buttons
- Fully responsive design matching session delete page

### Phase 4: Backend Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED

#### 4.1 Add Driver Lap Counts to Context - IMPLEMENTED
**File**: `laptimes/views.py` - `SessionDetailView.get_context_data()`

```python
# Add driver lap counts for enhanced display
driver_lap_counts = {}
for driver in context["drivers"]:
    driver_lap_counts[driver] = all_laps.filter(driver_name=driver).count()
context["driver_lap_counts"] = driver_lap_counts
```

**Status**: ✅ Successfully implemented in SessionDetailView (lines 191-195)

#### 4.2 Enhanced Delete Confirmation Message - IMPLEMENTED
**File**: `laptimes/views.py` - `DriverDeleteView.post()` method

Updated success message with proper pluralization:
```python
messages.success(
    request,
    f'Successfully removed driver "{driver_name}" and all {lap_count} lap{"" if lap_count == 1 else "s"} from this session.',
)
```

**Status**: ✅ Successfully implemented in DriverDeleteView with proper grammatical pluralization
